My first workink fishtank pH controller.

- ATMega328PB
- Analog circuit with op-amps for pH probe
- DS18B20 with waterproof shell as temperature sensor

3D printed housing as my first 3D design project.

 I started implement Bluetooth communication. Serial connection works great with terminal. I made also a simple Android app with Android Studio.
